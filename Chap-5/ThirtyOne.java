Some of the heat is trapped by greenhouse gases as carbon dioxide which is released by various human activities.%n%n");
		
		System.out.printf("Question 2: Correct answer is option c%nExplanation: The carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has increased about 30 percent since pre-industrial times. It causing more heat to trapped in the lower atmosphere. Human activities, industrialization and population growth are the main reasons.%n%n");

Global warming is accelerating faster than that calculated by climatologists. It was predicted in 1995 that in 21st century there would be raise in temperature by 3.5 to 10 degree Celsius.%n%n");
